			<b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</b> 
			Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
			when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
			book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
			typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br /><br />
			<i>It was popularised in the 1960s</i> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
